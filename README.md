## Problem Definition
Competitiveness, market share, professional development and personal support to community action, health, culture, education and sport, are linked to a promising new market. Coupled with the development of organizations, the pressure to achieve goals more audacious, employees increasingly overwhelmed, they end up buying some disturbance in the health-related type of labor activity. <br>
**The objective of this project is to apply some machine learning algorithms in the prediction of absenteeism at work.** The database is the information collected records of absenteeism from work during the period of July 2007 to July 2010 in a Courier company. Absences certified with the International Classification of Diseases were stratified into 21 categories, the data were tabulated and stored in two datasets (training and testing set).

The data for this analysis is taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work#)

## Result
* The accuracy of the training model is about 85.95%.
* The accuracy of the model when given a set of new data is 78.87%.
